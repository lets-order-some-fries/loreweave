 * symlinked folder, was allowed straight through. Both paths here are driven
 * by an agent over MCP, so the difference is not academic.
 *
 * Reads and writes get different answers on purpose.
 *
 * `scanVault` follows symlinked folders deliberately — a folder symlinked into
 * a vault used to be silently invisible, which was its own bug — so those
 * notes are indexed, are returned by search, and must be readable. Refusing to
 * read them would leave search returning results that cannot be opened.
 *
 * Writing is not implied by any of that. Linking a folder in so its notes can
 * be found does not ask the engine to create files inside it, so writes are
 * held to the real vault root: symlinks resolved, no exceptions.
