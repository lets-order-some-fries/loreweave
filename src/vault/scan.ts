/**
 * Why a vault-relative path is not a note, or null when it is one.
 *
 * This is the single definition of "note" for the engine. The scanner, the
 * MCP `read_note` tool and `capture` each used to carry their own, and the
 * three disagreed in ways that all leaked something:
 *
 * - `read_note` checked only the basename, so `.private/diary.md`,
 *   `node_modules/pkg/README.md` and `.lore/notes.md` — none of which the
 *   scanner ever indexes — were handed back in full on request.
 * - The scanner and `read_note` both gated on the LINK's name, so a symlink
 *   called `leak.md` pointing at `~/.ssh/id_rsa` was indexed, returned by
 *   search and served verbatim. SECURITY.md's highest-priority class.
 * - `capture` wrote into `.lore/`, `node_modules/` and `lore/digests/`,
 *   reported success, and the next index deleted the note.
 *
 * A path is a note iff no directory segment starts with `.` or is in the
 * ignore set, it is not under a derived prefix, its basename is a non-dotfile
 * `.md`, and — when `root` is given — the resolved target is a regular file
 * whose own basename is a non-dotfile `.md`. The last clause is what keeps a
 * symlinked FOLDER of genuine notes indexable (the real file is `x.md`) while
 * refusing a symlink whose target is anything else.
